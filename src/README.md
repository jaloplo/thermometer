# THERMOMETER project

Thermometer project is a SPA (Single Page Application) that lets users get the temperature of her current localization and change the scale to Celsius, Farenheit or Kelvin degrees. The reasons I'm working on it is for learning and practicing coding, patterns and best practices.
