# Thermometer project

**Thermometer** project is a web application built in order to practice and learn Vanilla _javascript_ and _Vue.js_. Being able to build an app from the scratch and set a code architecture that can evolve and is easy to understand, those are my goals and think most of them has been reached in this project.

Thermometer project is a SPA (Single Page Application) that lets users get a random temperature and change the scale from Celsius to Farenheit or Kelvin. I tried to keep it simple in order to achieve the goals previously explained but this can grow up adding more and more features just for keeping on practicing and learning.

Some of the techinques applied are:
* _Single Responsability_, the first rule of SOLID paradigm, 
* _MVC pattern_, for managing the application itseld,
* _Currying technique_, used to make code easier to read),
* _Promises_, for simulating API call to get the weather of the user location,
* _Status pattern_, just for knowing if API call has ended.


## More stuff

Thermometer project makes me able to write articles about the lessons learned. Here you have the first one:

* _**[Currying to make readable code](https://dev.to/jaloplo/currying-to-improve-javascript-code-3mg9)**_: This article explains how to create code easier to read so easier to maintain.


## Contribute

If you want to contribute adding some more stuff like:

* API call techniques,
* Vue.js best practices,
* HTML structure,
* CSS techniques,
* etc.
